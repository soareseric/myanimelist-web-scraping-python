<h1 align="center"> My Anime List - Web Scraping using Python </h1>

We will work with Web Scraping, Data Combination, Data Formatting, and then Data Analysis. Let's do this step by step, starting with Data Collection and ending with the delivery of Analyzed Data.

## About the Project

MyAnimeList, often abbreviated as MAL, is an anime and manga social networking and social cataloging application website run by volunteers. The site provides its users with a list-like system to organize and score anime and manga.

We need to extract the data from the site to answer this 10 questions:

- What are the average score of animes?
- What anime has the highest number of votes?
- What are the different types of animes?
- What is the average score of anime by types?
- What are the different anime fonts styles?
- How many animes are available in Portuguese?
- How many animes have co-producers?
- Are there any anime without producers?
- How many times has each producer participated in anime production?
- For the producer with the most participation, what is the average score, popularity and number of members?
